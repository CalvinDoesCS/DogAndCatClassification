# Dog and Cat Classification

This project was my final project for CSC4850. I was intereseted about neural networks and wanted to understand how does classifcation work in detail. I worked in a team of 3 other students and wrote all the code and train all the models. 

## Objectives
* Build a CNN network to classify Dogs and Cats using a pre-trained model(VGG-16)
* Build a KNN model to classify Dogs and Cats 
* Be able to visualize the features for each model using the Grad-Cam Method and Saliency Map
* Be able to use cross-validation techniques

## DataSet Overview
* The dataset is taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chetankv/dogs-cats-images) and contains images of cats and dogs.
* The dataset was pre-separated into cats and dogs.
* The dataset had a 20% testing set and 80% training set
